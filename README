This soft is for making time lapse from the local IP camera

Before each use (except for continuing the session), you must delete the folder "faremes"
in the location of the executable file "main.exe".
When you run the "main.exe" file, a window will open with the current video stream from your camera.
To stop the program normally, press "q" on the keyboard in THIS stream window.

The settings file "settings.txt" must be in the same folder as the executable file!
File "settings.txt" contains ALL the necessary session settings:
1. USER: AMLab
2. PASS: ***...***
3. IP: 192.168.226.201
4. PORT: 554
5. ADDRESS: profile1
6. TIMEOUT: 600
7. FREQUENCY: 10
8. CURRENTFRAME: 0
9. SAVEMODE: 1

Each parameter and value must be separated by a SPACE!

2. Password - your password
3. IP address - IP address of your camera
4. Port - port of your camera
5. Address - "rtsp://IP or domain name:port/profile1" this is RTSP-connection address of your camera
